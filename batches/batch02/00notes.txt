TDS Edited Examples List - Batch 2

T297 | Kelsey Lussier | complete | All issues resolved. Added cross-staff notes, hanging ties, changed dynamics from text to **dynam, fixed voicing of LH pno
T314 | Kelsey Lussier | complete | Fixed pitch mistakes and editorial accidentals, fixed rhythm so that tuplets will render. Issue with unmeasured gliss in the final two measures, mid-staff beam missing, 8va line missing, gliss line missing.
T318 | Kelsey Lussier | in progress |
T321 | Kelsey Lussier | in progress |
T322B| Kelsey Lussier | complete | Fixed editorial dynamics and editorial tempo with square brackets, changed notated meter, integrated text and dynamics, added visible (cautionary) accidentals. Remaining issue: hanging slur at the start of Violin 1 part not visible
T328 | Kelsey Lussier | complete | Changed articulation placement (below) and stem directions, added brackets to editorial dynamics and tempo. Remaining issues: cross meaure beaming not visible, articulations (slurs and stacattos) colliding with beams, slur in mm. 3-4 not visible because it bridges a spine re-convergence, missing pedal brackets beneath the staff. Piano fingering numbers not added.
T330 | Kelsey Lussier | complete | Fixed articulation placement, changed text-encoded dynamics to **dynam columns, added editorial brackets to starting dynamics and tempo. Remaining issues: cross-bar and triple-grouped beams (in a duple time signature) not showing
T331 | Kelsey Lussier | complete | fixed (editorial) dynamics, added string harmonics (as text), fixed slurs. Issues with missing portamento lines, string harmonics encoded as text
T334 | Daniel Wright | complete | System decoration is not displaying correctly. In addition, Cross-Measure Beaming still needs to be applied to this file. 
T335 | Daniel Wright | complete | Vln's need Bracket in System Decoration, Tpt 1 needs dynamic above staff in mm. 113, Cross-Measure Beaming still needs to be applied.
T336 | Daniel Wright | complete | LH measures 208-211 need Braces between 1st and 2nd Layers, to show that the Dyads are played simultaneously. RH only Dynamics need to be placed above the staff. Cross-Measure Beaming still needs to be applied to this file. 
T337 | Daniel Wright | krn. file empty on GitHub |
T339 | Daniel Wright | complete | Should be a brace between Vla. + Vc. showing that the battute sign applies to both parts. Example still needs Cross-Measure Beaming.
T340 | Daniel Wright | complete | Dynamics for Clarinet I should be above the staff, like Voice Dynamics.Cross-Measure Beaming still needs to be applied to this file. 
T342 | Daniel Wright | complete | 8ba symbol not rendering or putting ottava notes in correct octave. Cross-measure beaming still needs to be applied to this file.
T343 | Daniel Wright | complete | Cross-measure beaming still needs to be applied to this file.
T345 | Daniel Wright | complete |
T346 | Daniel Wright | complete | Bartók pizz. feature still missing from VHV; problems have been added to parts where Bartók pizzicato was indicated.
T352 | Daniel Wright | complete | Cross-measure beaming still needs to be applied to this file.
T353 | Daniel Wright | complete | Cross-measure beaming still needs to be applied to this file.
