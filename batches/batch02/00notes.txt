T297 | Kelsey Lussier | Daniel Wright (2022/1/28) | complete | 
T314 | Kelsey Lussier | Daniel Wright (2022/1/28) | complete | Cross-measure beaming still needs to be implemented, gliss line missing in the final two measures, mid-staff beam missing, tuplet number not displaying where it should.
T318 | Kelsey Lussier | Daniel Wright (2022/1/28) | complete | 
T321 | Kelsey Lussier | Daniel Wright (2022/1/28) | complete | Cross-measure beaming still needs to be implemented.
T322B| Kelsey Lussier | Daniel Wright (2022/1/28) | complete | 
T328 | Kelsey Lussier | Daniel Wright | not double checked | Changed articulation placement (below) and stem directions, added brackets to editorial dynamics and tempo. Remaining issues: cross meaure beaming not visible, articulations (slurs and stacattos) colliding with beams, slur in mm. 3-4 not visible because it bridges a spine re-convergence, missing pedal brackets beneath the staff. Piano fingering numbers not added.
T330 | Kelsey Lussier | Daniel Wright | not double checked | Fixed articulation placement, changed text-encoded dynamics to **dynam columns, added editorial brackets to starting dynamics and tempo. Remaining issues: cross-bar and triple-grouped beams (in a duple time signature) not showing
T331 | Kelsey Lussier | Daniel Wright | not double checked | fixed (editorial) dynamics, added string harmonics (as text), fixed slurs. Issues with missing portamento lines, string harmonics encoded as text
