T397 | Daniel Wright | complete | Oboe 1+2 have colliding rests in the 2nd Measure of the excerpt. File still needs Cross-Measure Beaming applied.
T398 | Daniel Wright | incomplete | kern has many rhythmic errors causing VHV to not display the excerpt.
T402 | Daniel Wright | complete | Dashed Lines between Tempo Indications, and between Text needs to be straightened out from one measure to the next. Also, 2nd layer full-measure rests need to be consistently visible below the staff and on the same horizontal plane as each other. 
T403 | Daniel Wright | complete | Rit. should have a dashed line extending from the sign until beat 3 of measure 7; also the septuplet in mm. 8 should be treated as eighth notes - 7:6, not as a 16th notes.
